 TRAP handler
 TRAP #15 is used for I/O.
 D0 contains the task number:

 Trap codes 0 - 12 are designed to be compatible with the Teesside simulator.

  0 - Display string at (A1), D1.W bytes long (max 255) with CRLF.
  1 - Display string at (A1), D1.W bytes long (max 255) without CRLF.
  2 - Read keyboard string starting at (A1) length returned in D1.W (max 80)
  3 - Display number in D1.L in decimal in smallest field.
  4 - Read a number from keyboard into D1.L.
  5 - Read single char from keyboard into D1.B.
  6 - Display single char in D1.B.
  7 - Set D1.B to 1 if keyboard input is pending, otherwise set to 0.
      Use code 5 to read pending key.
  8 - Return time in hundredths of a second since midnight in D1.L.
  9 - Terminate the program.

 10 - (not Teeside compatible)
      Print null terminated character string at (A1) to default printer.
      D1.B = 00 to print
      D1.B = 01 to end printing and feed form

-SCREEN HANDLING-
 11 - Set Cursor Position; Return Cursor Position, Clear Screen.
      Set Cursor Position: The high byte of D1.W holds the COL
      number (0-79), the low byte holds the ROW number (0-24). 0,0 is top
      left 79,24 is the bottom right. Out of range coordinates are ignored.
      Return Cursor Position: Set D1.W to $00FF. Returns COL in high byte of
      D1.W and ROW in low byte of D1.W.
      Clear Screen : Set D1.W to $FF00.

 12 - Keyboard Echo. Setting D1.B to 0 will turn off keyboard echo, D1.B to
      non zero will enable it (default). Echo is restored on 'Reset' or when
      a new file is loaded.

      ***************************************************************
      ***** The following Trap Codes are NOT Teeside compatible *****
      ***************************************************************

 13 - Display the NULL terminated string at (A1) (max 255) with CRLF.
 14 - Display the NULL terminated string at (A1) (max 255) without CRLF.
 15 - Display the contents of D1.L converted to number base (2 to 36) contained
      in D2.B. For example, to display D1.L in base16 put 16 in D2.B
      Values of D2.B outside the range 2 to 36 inclusive are ignored.
 16 - Turn on/off the display of the input prompt.
      D1.B = 0 to turn off the display of the input prompt.
      D1.B = 1 to turn on the display of the input prompt.(default)
      D1.B = 2 do not display line feed on Enter key during Trap code #2 input
      D1.B = 3 display line feed on Enter key during Trap code #2 input (default)
      Other values of D1 reserved for future use.
      Input prompt display is enabled by default and by 'Reset' or when a
      new file is loaded.
 17 - Combination of Trap codes 14 & 3. Displays the NULL terminated string at
      (A1) without CRLF then displays the decimal number in D1.L.
 18 - Combination of Trap codes 14 & 4. Displays the NULL terminated string at
      (A1) without CRLF then reads a number from the keyboard into
      D1.L.
 19 - Return keypress state for specified keys.
      pre:  D1.L = up to 4 bytes of keycodes to check
      post: D1.L = corresponding byte set to $00 if key up, $FF if key down
        or
      pre:  D1.L = 0
      post: D1.L upper word contains key code of last key up. (Sim68K v4.7.3 and newer)
            D1.L lower word contains key code of last key down.

          8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18
          Font sizes in multiples of valid sizes ( size * n) results in a scaled
          appearance. For example: in Fixedsys font sizes of 9*2, 9*3, ..9*n
          will result in larger characters but the characters will have very
          pixelated edges.

          High word (high byte) is Font
          1 is Fixedsys       (valid sizes: 9)

-SERIAL I/O-
The success of the calls below is determined from D0.W in each case. A value
of zero indicates success.

40 : INIT PORT. This should be called once for each COM port to be used
     before any other serial I/O function.
     The port defaults to 9600 baud, 8 Databits, No parity, One stop bit
     Pre:
       High 16 bits of D0 contain comm port identifier CID, (0 through 15).
       The comm port identifier is used to identify the comm port in all other
       comm tasks. It is not used to specify the comm port number,
       (e.g. A CID of 4 does not mean the same thing as COM4)
       (A1) name of serial port as null terminated string (e.g. COM4).
     Post:
       D0.W is 0 on success, 1 on invalid CID, 2 on error.
41 : SET PORT PARAMETERS
     Pre:
       High 16 bits of D0 contain comm port identifier CID, (0 through 15).
       D1.L
       Bits 0-7 (D1.B)
            port speed: 0=default, 1=110 baud, 2=300, 3=600,
            4=1200, 5=2400, 6=4800, 7=9600, 8=19200, 9=38400,
            10=56000, 11=57600, 12=115200, 13=128000, 14=256000.
       Bits 8-9
            parity: 0=no, 1=odd, 2=even, 3=mark
       Bits 10-11
            number of data bits: 0=8 bits, 1=7 bits, 2=6 bits
       Bit  12
            stop bits: 0=1 stop bit, 1=2 stop bits
       The higher bits of D1.L are reserved for future use.
     Post:
       D0.W is 0 on success, 1 on invalid CID, 2 on error
       3 on comm port not initialized.

     Pre:
       CID required as used in 40.
       (A1) buffer address,
       D1.B number of characters to read.
       If no char has been received it will timeout after 100 milli-seconds.
     Post:
       D0.W is 0 on success, 1 on invalid CID, 2 on error
       3 on comm port not initialized, 4 on timeout.
       D1.B number of characters read.
       (A1) null terminated string of characters
43 : SEND STRING.
     Pre:
       CID required as used in 40.
       (A1) buffer address,
       D1.B number of characters to send.
       If unable to send characters it will timeout after 100 milli-seconds.
     Post:
       D0.W is 0 on success, 1 on invalid CID, 2 on error
       3 on comm port not initialized, 4 on timeout.
       D1.B number of characters sent.

-FILE HANDLING-
  The success of the file handling calls is returned in D0.W as follows:
        0 = success
        1 = EOF encountered
        2 = Error
        3 = File is Read-Only (task 51 & 59 only)
  A maximum of 8 files may be open at any one time.

 50 - CLOSE ALL FILES. It is recommended to use this at the start of any
      program using file handling.
 51 - OPEN EXISTING file. (A1) null terminated path address. On return, D1.L
      contains the File-ID (FID). The FID is unique to each file and is a
      required arg for the other calls.
 52 - OPEN NEW FILE. As above except the file is created if not found. If
      the file exists it will be overwritten.
 53 - READ FILE. FID in D1 as returned from 51/52. (A1) buffer address, D2.L
      no. of bytes to read. On return D2 holds number of bytes actaully read.
      EOF will cause a shortened read.
 54 - WRITE FILE. As above except D2.L holds number of bytes to write
      (unaltered upon return).
 55 - POSITION FILE. Sets the file position where the next read/write will take
      place. Files begin at byte 0. FID in D1 as returned from 51/52, D2
      contains the file position to be set.
 56 - CLOSE FILE. FID in D1 as returned from 51/52.
 57 - DELETE FILE. (A1) null terminated path address.
 58 - DISPLAY FILE DIALOG
      Pre:
        D1 = 0 to display 'Open' dialog
        D1 = 1 to display 'Save' dialog
        (A1)    Points to a null terminated string that will be used as the
                request title string or A1=$00000000 to use the default
                'Load file' or 'Save file' depending on D1
        (A2)    Points to a null terminated string containing semicolon seperated
                list of file extensions for use in dialog, e.g. '*.txt;*.pcb',0
                or A2=$00000000 for all file types.
        (A3)    Points to a buffer of sufficient size to hold the zero
                terminated full file path and name.
                On calling, if this contains a file path and name this will be
                used as the original file path and name.
                If the user exits via the cancel button this buffer will
                remain unchanged.
      Post:
        D1 = 0 if user cancelled or just closed
        D1 = 1 if user hit open/save
 59 - FILE OPERATION. (A1) null terminated path address.
        D1.L = 0 does file exist, all other values reserved


-PERIPHERAL I/O-
 60 - MOUSE IRQ. Enable/Disable mouse IRQ
      An IRQ is created when a mouse button is pressed or released in the output window.
      D1.W High Byte = IRQ level (1-7), 0 to turn off
      D1.W Low Byte = Mouse event that triggers IRQ:

 62 - Key IRQ. Enable/Disable keyboard IRQ
      An IRQ is created when a key is pressed or released in the output window.
      D1.W High Byte = IRQ level (1-7), 0 to turn off
      D1.W Low Byte = Key event that triggers IRQ:
                      Bit1 = Button Up, Bit0 = Button Down
      (Example D1.W = $0103, Enable Key IRQ level 1 for Key Up and Key Down)
